```bash
pip install dalle2
```

# Usage
## Setup
1. Go to https://labs.openai.com/
1. Open Network Tab in Developer Tools
1. Type a prompt and press "Generate"
1. Look for fetch to https://labs.openai.com/api/labs/tasks
1. In the request header look for authorization then get the Bearer Token

```python
from dalle2 import Dalle2
dalle = Dalle2("sess-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx") # your bearer key
```

## Generate images
```python
generations = dalle.generate("portal to another dimension, digital art")
print(generations)
```

## Generate images and download them
```python
file_paths = dalle.generate_and_download("portal to another dimension, digital art")
```

## Generate a specific number of images
```python
generations = dalle.generate_amount("portal to another dimension", 8) # Every generation has batch size 4 -> amount % 4 == 0 works best

# download images
file_paths = dalle.download(generations)
print(file_paths)

## Generate images from a masked file
DALL·E supports an "inpainting" API that fills-in transparent parts of an image.
The website provides a tool to paint over an existing image to indicate which
parts you want to be transparent. This Python package call assumes that the
image you provide has already been processed to have transparent parts.

```python
# make the right half of a saved image transparent
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

image = Image.open('my_image.png')
m, n = image.size

area_to_keep = (0, 0, m//2, n)
image_alpha = Image.new("L", image.size, 0)
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image_alpha)
draw.rectangle(area_to_keep, fill=255)

image_rgba = image.copy()
image_rgba.putalpha(image_alpha)
image_rgba.save('image_with_transparent_right_half.png')

# ask DALL·E to fill-in the transparent right half
generations = dalle.generate_from_masked_image(
    "portal to another dimension, digital art",
    "image_with_transparent_right_half.png",
)
```

## Dry runs

If you are playing around and don't want to waste credits, you can use the dry run option, eg

```
dalle.generate(..., dry=True)
dalle.generate_amount(...., dry=True)
dalle.generate_and_download(...., dry=True)
```

This will circumvent the call to openAI but will still generate some random data so if you use the
output of `generate` to `download`, it will download random images.
